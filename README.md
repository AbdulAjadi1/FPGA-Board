High-Fidelity DAC Sound system with FPGA-Based Room Correction

Achieving high-fidelity production in a room is challenging due to various acoustic factors such as reflections, standing waves, and frequency imbalances caused by the room’s shape, furniture, and equipment. So, this project aims to design and implement a high-fidelity DAC sound system utilizing an FPGA and FIR/IIR filters for room correction. 
Feasibility of this project based on the Engineering Method

Using the format of the Engineering Method, this project has been structured in different phases:
Problem Identification: Due to the distortion in sound waves, echoes, and the room’s internal disturbances, it leads to uneven frequency responses affecting the overall quality of sound. This project aims to develop a system which will ensure accurate and balanced audio production across different listening environments. 
Concept: In this phase, we will conduct research on high-fidelity DAC designs, room correction algorithms and FIR/IIR filter implementations. We will also identify the suitable hardware components, including FPGA, PCB and input sources.
Planning: This is the crucial phase of the project where we will create the timeline between two semesters for the project and allocate the work among group members. We’ll also plan the components and also will define clear milestones for the project which includes System design, PCB design, and FIR/IIR implementation.
Design: In this phase, we will design and develop a FPGA-based audio processing system, incorporating input selection, FIR/IIR filter implementation and DAC output processing . 
Development: Once the system design is ready, we will proceed to assemble and test the prototype to identify possible errors and troubleshoot. We’ll use test tones and different measurement tools to analyze room acoustics and compare the corrected and uncorrected audio responses to examine the system effectiveness. 
Launch: After the development phase, we will finalize the whole system ensuring its reliability across different environments. Once the system is ready, we will launch it and will be usable for others as well. 
The project can be accomplished in two semesters because we have a team of four so we can assign tasks evenly to ensure efficiency. We will go through the steps listed above in the engineering method of project structuring.
